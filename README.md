# PERLeetCode
Collection of LeetCode Problems I've solved using Perl.

**FirstNonRepeatingCharacter:**
"Given a string 's' consisting of small English letters, find and return the first instance of a non-repeating character in it. If there is no such character, return '_'.
For 's = "abacabad"', the output should be 'c'.

**Two Sum:**
Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to target.
You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may not use the same element twice.
Example: With the input "nums = [2,7,11,15], target = 22", the output should be "[1, 3]"

**Roman to Integer:** Given a roman numeral, convert it to an integer.
